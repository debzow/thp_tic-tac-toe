# The Hacking Project - Tic-tac-toe


## :mag: The content
In these exercises, I simply had to reproduce a **Tic-tac-toe *in the terminal***.
* What is Tic-tac-toe ? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe

**After cloning the repository, make sure to do :**
```sh
$ cd thp_tic-tac-toe
$ bundle install
```
This will install all the dependencies needed for the exercises.
